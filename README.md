# Dashboards-with-Dash
This workshop is designed to introduce how to create dashboards using Dash. The dashboard tracks common stock metrics retrieved from the unofficial Yahoo Finance wrapper API, yahooquery.

### Installation
It is ideal to run this in a virtual environment. To do this, run the following commands.
1. `pip install virtualenv`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `source venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `ipython kernel install --user --name=dash`

Then to launch the notebook, run `jupyter-lab` in the directory with the files.

Made for the Data Visualization Lab @ Georgia Tech.
