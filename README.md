# Dashboards-with-Dash
This workshop is designed to introduce how to create dashboards using Dash. The dashboard tracks common stock metrics retrieved from the unofficial Yahoo Finance wrapper API, yahooquery.

### Installation
It is ideal to run this in a virtual environment. To do this, run the following commands.
1. `pip install virtualenv`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `source venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `ipython kernel install --user --name=dash`

Then to launch the notebook, run `jupyter-lab` in the directory with the files.

### Workshop Files
* **Dashboard.ipynb** The fully completed version of the workshop notebook. Running this file will create the .py files needed to create the application
* **HandsOn_Dashboard** The uncompleted version of the workshop notebook. Code will be filled in during the workshop

Made for the Data Visualization Lab @ Georgia Tech.
